# Ria Weather App
#### Presentation Video: https://youtu.be/wY-8wZL8mRQ

## Overview

This weather app was created with a Flux architecture using React utilizing a simple JSON rest API, so you can find on src/Store/Flux.js the end points.
I also used a component based architecture with Styled-Components so on src/Components you will find all the components and on src/Styles, some shared or the main CSS aplied.

I use 3 default cities to be shown, but It's ready to be scalable if a data base and authentication method is added.

You can find it on [this online demo](https://ria-weather-app.netlify.app/)
